📌 Join

Join is a collaborative Kanban board built for teams. It lets all team members create, view, and manage tasks in real time — helping teams stay organized and productive. The app uses Firebase Real-Time Database, allowing users to register or log in as guests, and keeps everyone’s data synchronized.
